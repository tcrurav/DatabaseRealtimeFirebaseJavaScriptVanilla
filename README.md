# Chat using Firebase With Javascript Vanilla

This is just a simple Chat example using Firebase with JavaScript Vanilla.

## Getting Started

Start cloning this project:

````
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/DatabaseRealtimeFirebaseJavaScriptVanilla.git
````

Follow the tutorial to create a Firebase project: (It's not necessary to follow the whole video. Just to create the firebase project)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP7quzFmWBY

When you have your Project Data just copy it in the file js/firebase-setup.js:

````
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  databaseURL: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  appId: ""
};
````

Now you can run your index.html page.

Enjoy!
